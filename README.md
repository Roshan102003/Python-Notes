# Python-Notes
This is a repo of mine which contains my Python Notes that I made while learning Python from CWH. It involves all the concepts and technique in the form of comment!
It contains Chapter wise Python Syllabus and 2 minor projects which I made on the way in the course offered by CWH.
Hope you find this helpful. :)
